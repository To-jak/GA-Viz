G\+A-\/\+Viz is a data visualization tool for genetic algorithms. Created in cooperation between Universiti Teknologi Petronas, E\+S\+AD Reims and J\+IN (Jeux vidéo / Intéractions et collaborations numériques) of Evry. This is an end of studies\textquotesingle{} project from J\+IN developped by Cloquet Benjamin (T\+SP), Freyssinet Olivier (T\+SP), Jacquemin Thomas (T\+SP), Person Victor (E\+N\+S\+I\+IE) and Touchard Pierre (X).

\subsection*{Getting Started}

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

The project runs with Qt 5.\+8+ and needs at least Glibc 2.\+17, Zlib 1.\+2.\+3.\+4 and gcc 5.\+0 to run on a deploy target.

\subsubsection*{Installing}

Go to the app directory and run the make command or run the bundled appimage.

\subsection*{Deployment}

To deploy the application, the easiest way is to directly use linuxdeployqt ( \href{https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt} ) to create an appimage which can run on all up-\/to-\/date unix systems.
