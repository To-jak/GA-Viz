# GA-Viz

GA-Viz is a data visualization tool for genetic algorithms. Created in cooperation between Universiti Teknologi Petronas, ESAD Reims and JIN (Jeux vidéo / Intéractions et collaborations numériques) of Evry. This is an end of studies' project from JIN developped by Cloquet Benjamin (TSP), Freyssinet Olivier (TSP), Jacquemin Thomas (TSP), Person Victor (ENSIIE) and Touchard Pierre (X).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project runs with Qt 5.8+ and needs at least Glibc 2.17, Zlib 1.2.3.4 and gcc 5.0 to run on a deploy target.

### Installing

Go to the app directory and run the make command or run the bundled appimage.

### Exemples

There are two exemples : GA_Out_Clustered and xaa (inside xaa.zip). The first is a rather small file and the second is a 100Mo file to test.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, the easiest way is to directly use linuxdeployqt ( https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt ) to create an appimage which can run on all up-to-date unix systems. You can also download appimage from the release section

## Built With

* [QtCreator](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/) - multi desktop application IDE
